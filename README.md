# Face Detection Project
## Overview
This is a Python project that uses OpenCV and the Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time video feed from a webcam.

## Features
Face Detection: The project uses the Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in the video feed.

Real-time Video Feed: The project captures video from the webcam and applies face detection in real-time.

Visualization: The detected faces are highlighted with a rectangle in the video feed.

## Requirements
Python: The project requires Python 3.x to run.

OpenCV: The project uses OpenCV for computer vision tasks. You can install OpenCV using pip: pip install opencv-python.

Haar Cascade Classifier: The project uses the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection. This is included in the OpenCV package.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. If you'd like to contribute, please create a new issue describing your proposed changes and how they will improve the project.

## Credits
